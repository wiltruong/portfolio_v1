<h1>Hello!</h1>

I’m a third year, Interaction Design student at Sheridan College. I have a background in Human Resources/Recruitment (Campus) and have high interpersonal skills along with super-duper communication skills. I love working on UI design and figuring out how users can interact with it in different ways! Other than that... I love to figure out ways to make my designs be accessible and include diversity & inclusion.

<h1>My design philosophy</h1>

> Thinking about everyone and everyone in-between.

I think about the user at hand, how he/she uses it and who will be using it. With my previous experience as a recruiter, I care about diversity, inclusion and accessibility. When I say design should be accessible to everyone, I mean everyone. Those who have a disability, or the elderly, or LGBT+ or even someone who isn’t familiar with technology, those are the “everyone” that I speak to.

> Simplicity is key to everything.

Having seen design evolve from the early 2000s until now, it has drastically changed with companies like Apple and Google. I believe that design should be simple and clean, not overly complicated but enabling the user to understand the purpose of the product of application. When things are simple, the allows the user to be stress free and enjoy the things that they want the fullest.

> Going beyond the unconventional.

Being a designer means to me is the freedom to go beyond what everyone is doing. Whether if it is creating something that is unconventional, or going beyond the present, I strive to create something unique that would enable those to think.
