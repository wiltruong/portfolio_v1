<h1>Hello!</h1>

I’m currently an Interaction Design student at Sheridan College, now in my second year, I’m learning lots about UX/UI and want to do more with UI design. I have a background in Human Resources and Recruitment (Campus) and have high interpersonal skills along with super-duper communication skills.

I’m motivated to design things that involve with diversity and accessibility. From my background in Human Resources, diversity is important to me. I also love working on product design and figuring out how users can interact in different ways.

<h1>My design philosophy</h1>

<br>

> Thinking about everyone and everyone inbetween.

As a UX/UI designer, I think about the user at hand, how he/she uses it and who will be using it. With my previous experience as a Recruiter, I care about diversity. When I say design should be accessible to everyone, I mean everyone. Those who have a disability, or the elderly, or LGBT+ or even someone who isn’t familiar with technology, those are the “everyone” that I speak to.

<br>

> Simplicity is key to everything.

Having seen the evolve in design from the early 2000s until now, it has drastically changed with companies like Apple and Google. I believe that design should be simple and clean, not overly complicated but enabling the user to understand the purpose of the product of application. When things are simple, the allows the user to be stress free and enjoy the things that they want the fullest.

<br>

> Going beyond the unconventional.

Being a designer means to me is the freedom to go beyond what everyone is doing. Whether if it is creating something that is unconventional, or going beyond the present, I strive to create something unique that would enable those to think.
