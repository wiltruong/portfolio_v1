<h1>Hello!</h1>

Iâ€™m a third year, Interaction Design student at Sheridan College. I have a background in Human Resources/Recruitment (Campus) and have high interpersonal skills along with super-duper communication skills. I love working on UI design and figuring out how users can interact with it in different ways! Other than that... I love to figure out ways to make my designs be accessible and include diversity & inclusion.
