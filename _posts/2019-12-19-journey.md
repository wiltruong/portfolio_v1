### The idea

Academic integrity is a subject that isn't really thought about much but is somewhat at the back of our heads during an academic career. With having went to college and university for a while, I learned the importance of academic integrity and it's seriousness but through my professors. Our team thought about how can we get an user to constantly remind themselves that academic integrity is important? We thought about games or a checklist but they typically have their own slew of problems like incentives.

### The solution

We thought about the concept of how us students are constantly inspired by work done by other artists, writers, designers, researchers, and so much more. We as students, respect those designers or creators and often are reminded to respect their work by citing them in our work. Our idea was to create a platform where students can share their work and show their process work in how they got to the final product. By doing so, we believe that can influence students to properly cite their work as their peers are doing so.

We started to quickly put down a few keywords to narrow down our scope and what our app would do, in addition to sketching quick mockups of what it would look like.

### The final product

Our final design was to incorporate a look where it was friendly and inviting, having a mascot (we used free illustrations from <a href="https://icons8.com/ouch/>here</a>) defintely helped with the look.

### The take aways

I learned a lot through this project but in particular, functionality versus design. I wanted to create a more unique interactive experience where the user can hover over an object and it will highlight it. Although, due to the nature of three.JS, I had to reduce my models to simple shapes - Which affected the overall design.

I had an dilemma where I wanted the functionality but can I really sacrifice the visuals? Ultimately, I went with changing the pointer, rather than highlighing the object. As much as I was frustrated, I learned that sometimes you have provide a level of balance to aethestics and functionality. 

I wanted the visuals to be a core part of the experience and sacrificing it was something I wasn't prepared to do if I added the highlighting. I found out through some user testing with my friends that changing the pointer was just as effective as highlighting the object. Although, this was after my decision to move to something simplier, I was glad that I made that choice overall.
