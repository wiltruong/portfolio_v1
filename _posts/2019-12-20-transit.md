### Transit, the bane of a student's existence

For this project, the problem we had to solve was transit and students. We were to create a solution to create a better experience for students commuting to school. We were encouraged to create anything from a physical product or digital. I think as students, majority of our time is mostly commuting back and forth to classes. At times, it is stressing because of its various issues like rush hour, overcrowding, delays, and such. 

I decided to focus on the shuttle system that Sheridan provides, which was cut down to just two campuses in the recent year as a pilot project. My reason for focusing on Sheridan's shuttle system was due to a few factors: 1) Trying to think of a solution for students and transit, is really hard as there are a wack ton of options out there; 2) I had similar issues with the shuttle too when I first experienced it; 3) I wanted to create something truly unique just for Sheridan students.

### The solution

The idea was to integrate the shuttle and OneCard system that Sheridan uses (similarly to a card payment system) into an existing application called Transit. Eventually, the concept was to expand it to other school's shuttle/payment systems so that students have the best of both worlds: city transit on one hand and school funded transportation/payment on the other.

### The research

Research was done through interviews, since this project was small - I interviewed two students: One first year, using the shuttle and the other, a second-year student who is taking Oakville Transit. The research provided a few things: A "love-hate" relationship with the service, dissatisfaction, and the variability of the service.

Although, not everything was frustration as the interviews showed that they were happy that the service was there rather than not. Additional research was done in the form of observation, which was taking the shuttle and experiencing the commute - Which my conclusions were inline with the student who I interviewed.

From the research, personas were created and then scenarios (below) to simulate the functionality of the integration. With that in mind, design requirements were created to understand what the user wants from the personas/scenarios and then it was off to create the prototype.

### The solution

The issue with transit is that, it's complicated as many different people take Oakville (or other city transit) everyday to get to campus. Rather than trying to force a solution on to an existing transit system with its own problems, I focused on the shuttle experience. By integrating Sheridan's shuttle system and payment system, the application (Transit) can be used both ways: for students who commute using a city's transit system and for students who use the school's transportation system. A bonus is that students can reload their OneCard via the application, which is usually done through a website.

At the same time, I looked at other forms of notifcations and forms of providing a better experience overall. Since smartwatches are somewhat popular these days with the Apple Watch, I felt that it was appropriate that there was another option for the user to interact with other than a phone.

Wireframes were done first, then paper prototype testing to determine the user flow and the key frame scenarios. The idea was to integrate into the application, so it was straightforward, rather than building something from scratch.

But wait! Why these functions? My goal was to create convenience for the student. To reload an OneCard with funds, the student has to login to the website to reload. This is rather annoying since the student would either: need a computer or do it on the brower on their phone. Purchasing tickets is in a similar fashion, why make things hard when you can do it on your phone with ease?

### The final product

The final design had a few iterations as I wanted to match the aesthetic of the actual Transit app. There were some few things that I changed to the design of the Transit app to match the curved aesthetic look.

### The take aways

Throughout this project, the goal was to provide a solution to an existing problem. Including research and understanding the user, I learned a lot of things about designing a product. I realized that it's fairly challenging to design something new due to the existing things out that would enhance the commute experience (i.e. Uber, Google Maps). Although, with my own research, I applied my findings based on the user need and provided an unique experience.
