### The problem... And beyond

This project was done throughout the course term and revolved around a single topic: Climate change. This topic was huge and obviously I had to tackle it from a different direction. I had a few questions to myself: How can I create awareness? How can I educate the user? What can the user get out of from my interaction at the end? I thought about this long and hard and focused on: the message throughout the the interaction and the end.

I had a lot of ideas, ranging from how animals are being affected by climate change to carbon emissions to a life of people that has an eco-friendly life. They were good ideas but to be realistic, what can a user do in reality or in their current state? I realized that a typical average person can't phyiscally save Penguins or Polar Bears in the Arctic...

### The solution

I went with a simple idea of showing a life of an indivdual who has a low carbon footprint. The concept is to show the user on what he or she can do to make their lives more eco-friendly. My rationale for this was to bridge a connection between the user's interaction and the information that is being showed on the screen. For example: Instead of putting things like "buy an electric car to be environmentally friendly", the user can shut off their lights to save energy or recycle.

For the overall design, I went with an isometric design with multiple levels in a house. The interactivity is for the user to navigate and learn about the specific things that a person can do to reduce their carbon footprint. I felt that an isometric 3D design would be appropirate due to the interactions and how I wanted the user to see an overview of the house and its areas.

I did a mock up first (above) and prototype (below) and then moved on to the actual modeling.

### The final product

My final design was quite a departure from what I intially planned. To create a more intimate relationship with the user, I created a character where the user can relate to. This allowed me to create a tour like experience where the character is leading the user to various places in the house. I was very inspired by visual novels with text boxes and characters.

With the addition of the character, I wanted it to animate so that was done through Adobe's Mixamo and a few pieces of code that I referenced via a <a href="https://tympanus.net/codrops/2019/10/14/how-to-create-an-interactive-3d-character-with-three-js/">tutorial</a>. The idea was to let the character move it's head accordingly to the user's mouse. This was a fun little quirk that I implemented since the character is cute and all, it provided a more fun and relaxing experience.

### The take aways

I learned a lot through this project but in particular, functionality versus design. I wanted to create a more unique interactive experience where the user can hover over an object and it will highlight it. Although, due to the nature of three.JS, I had to reduce my models to simple shapes - Which affected the overall design.

I had an dilemma where I wanted the functionality but can I really sacrifice the visuals? Ultimately, I went with changing the pointer, rather than highlighing the object. As much as I was frustrated, I learned that sometimes you have provide a level of balance to aethestics and functionality. 

I wanted the visuals to be a core part of the experience and sacrificing it was something I wasn't prepared to do if I added the highlighting. I found out through some user testing with my friends that changing the pointer was just as effective as highlighting the object. Although, this was after my decision to move to something simplier, I was glad that I made that choice overall.
