### The idea

Climate change is a huge topic and is an important topic today among various youth and adults. This brings the question of creating awareness, what can the user get out of from my interaction at the end? I thought about this long and hard and focused on: the message throughout the the interaction and the end.

I had a lot of ideas, ranging from how animals are being affected by climate change to carbon emissions to a life of people that has an eco-friendly life. Ultimately, my ideas were complicated to execute.

### The solution

I went with an easy idea of showing an eco-life of an indivdual. The concept is to show the user on what he or she can do to make their lives more eco-friendly and reduce their carbon footprint. I wanted to connect the user to realistic things like turning off electronics rather than buying an electric car.

For the overall design, I went with an isometric design with multiple levels in a house. The interactivity is for the user to navigate and learn about the specific things that a person can do to reduce their carbon footprint.

### The take aways

I learned a lot through this project but in particular, functionality versus design. I wanted to create a more unique interactive experience where the user can hover over an object and it will highlight it. Although, due to the nature of three.JS, I had to reduce my models to simple shapes - Which affected the overall design.

I had an dilemma where I wanted the functionality but can I really sacrifice the visuals? Ultimately, I went with changing the pointer, rather than highlighing the object. As much as I was frustrated, I learned that sometimes you have provide a level of balance to aethestics and functionality. I wanted the visuals to be a core part of the experience and sacrificing it was something I wasn't prepared to do if I added the highlighting. I found out through some user testing with my friends that changing the pointer was just as effective as highlighting the object. Although, this was after my decision to move to something simplier, I was glad that I made that choice overall.
