### The problem... And beyond

This project was done throughout the course term and revolved around a single topic: Climate change. This topic was huge and obviously I had to tackle it from a different direction. I had a few questions to myself: 

<br>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th align="center"><img src="https://wilsontruong.com/images/posts/aware.png"></th>
    <th align="center"><img src="https://wilsontruong.com/images/posts/person.png"></th>

    <td align="center">How can I educate the user?</td>
    <td align="center">What can the user get out of it?</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<br>    

I thought about this long and hard and focused on the message throughout the narrative and the end. I had a lot of ideas but to be realistic, what can a user do or in their current state? I realized that a typical average person can't physically save Penguins or Polar Bears in the Arctic...

<br>

### The solution

I went with a simple idea of showing a life of an individual who has a low carbon footprint. The concept is to show the user on what he or she can do to make their lives eco-friendlier. I wanted to bridge a connection between the user's interaction and the information that is being showed on the screen. 

<br>

<b>For example:</b> Instead of putting things like "buy an electric car to be environmentally friendly", the user can bike and save money plus lower their carbon footprint.

  <tr>

    <th><b> Versus </b></th>
    <th align="center"><img src="https://wilsontruong.com/images/posts/bike.png"></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">Lower your carbon footprint by <br> buying an electric car.</td>
    <td> </td>
    <td align="center">Save money and lower your <br> carbon footprint by biking</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<br>    
    
For the overall design, I went with an isometric design with multiple levels in a house. The interactivity is for the user to navigate and learn about the specific things that a person can do to reduce their carbon footprint. I felt that an isometric 3D design would be appropriate due to the interactions and how I wanted the user to see an overview of the house and its areas.

### The final product

My final design was quite a departure from what I initially planned. To create a more intimate relationship with the user, I created a character where the user can relate to. This allowed me to create a tour like experience where the character is leading the user to various places in the house. I was very inspired by visual novels with text boxes and characters.

With the addition of the character, I wanted it to animate so that was done through Adobe's Mixamo and a few pieces of code that I referenced via a tutorial. The idea was to let the character move its head accordingly to the user's mouse. This was a fun little quirk that I implemented since the character is cute and all, it provided a more fun and relaxing experience.

### The take aways

This project was the most challenging project I’ve ever done in a class setting. I set high ambitions to create a narrative that would easily flow with what I envisioned. I overcame a lot of challenges and became resourceful in figuring out what I needed to do to make my vision happen. Somethings that I learned were:  

<br>

> Functionality versus visuals

I wanted to create a more unique interactive experience where the user can hover over an object and it will highlight it. Although, due to the nature of three.JS, I had to reduce my models to simple shapes - Which affected the overall design.
    
I had a dilemma where I wanted the functionality, but can I really sacrifice the visuals? Ultimately, I went with changing the pointer, rather than highlighting the object. As much as I was frustrated, I learned that sometimes you have provided a level of balance to aesthetics and functionality.

<br>

> Being resourceful 

I learned to be resourceful and search online for things that I wanted to implement. For animating my fox model, I followed a tutorial. For understanding how three.js worked, I looked up the documentation. I understood that my Professor didn’t have all the answers (plus helping other students) but gave good advice in my direction and overall design.

<br>

> Being flexible

I realized throughout the project; things were constantly changing. From coding to the visual design. Being flexible was important as I was quite stubborn with sticking to what I wanted. As I moved forward in the project, somethings were just not possible (i.e. highlighting the object). There were things that I had to change based on feedback, but I learned that being a designer means having to adjust and adapt to things that don’t work too well with the plan.
