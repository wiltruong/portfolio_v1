Minimalism 101?

In this hackathon, I teamed up with two of my friends against a whole ton of universities in the US, UK and Canada. The main theme is gaming, and we had the dauntless task of creating an app that caters to/informs new gamers. Our main concept was to create an app that provides recommendations to the user, in a easy and simple way. We took inspiration from Steam and other platforms (i.e. uPlay, Orgin, and Epic) and found a central theme: They were all overwhelming with games, especially for a new gamer. This can deter a new gamer due to too many choices and provide a high level of frustration.

We decided to focus on three main things for our app:

Usability
Simplicity
Information

Our goal was to provide an institutive UI where the user can easily navigate and easily find information (or recommendations in this case) within the app, without frustration.

The Process

With just 48 hours, we spent quite a bit of time talking about ideas and how we can execute them. We took the time to do a bit of research and taking a step back to view the overall picture of a new gamer, which aided us greatly. We started doing wireframes to start the process and then refined it further as we had a good design in mind.

The solution

Our solution was a simple and easy way of recommending a new player games based on their criteria. An onboarding process was made to ease in the user to the app and to tailor their preferences. The UI is centered around cards and minimalism, which results in a focus on the game and information shown.

The user can swipe left and right to show different recommendations, which makes it easy for the user to look for games and see the actual game. We selected cards as a form of UI because it was easy to show information and clean. We didn’t want to overload the user with multiple titles but rather one title at a time, until the user likes a recommended game.

We also added other elements like social media, sharing, wish lists, and favourites – Which enhances the experience further.

In the end, we wanted to reduce the frustration of finding games. Our secondary research showed that people often ask for recommendations online via social hubs like Reddit, Facebook, or Twitter. It shows that the abundance of games out there is quite large and is daunting to a new gamer today. We felt that we accomplished this by creating an app that is focused on doing one thing good, recommending quality games based on the user’s needs/preferences.

The take aways

Onboarding is key

Focus on one aspect

Working with other designers
In this hackathon, I was working with my peers in the same program and are designers. Compared to working with developers, it was quite different. Each of us had different perspectives, which was great, but I felt that at times we clashed together due to how we designed specific things. I think this was great as it enabled me to learn to compromise and use the strengths of my team members to maximize our efficiency. For example, one of my team members is great in identifying issues with UX and the other has great visual design skills.
