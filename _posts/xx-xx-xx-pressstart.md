### Us versus the world

In this hackathon, I teamed up with two of my friends against a whole ton of universities in the US, UK and Canada. The main theme is gaming, and we had the dauntless task of creating an app that caters to/informs new gamers. Our main concept was to create an app that provides recommendations to the user, in a easy and simple way. We took inspiration from Steam and other platforms (i.e. uPlay, Orgin, and Epic) and found a central theme: They were all overwhelming with games, especially for a new gamer. This can deter a new gamer due to too many choices and provide a high level of frustration.

We decided to focus on three main things for our app:

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">Usability</td>
    <td align="center">Simplicity</td>
    <td align="center">Information</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<br>    

Our goal was to provide an institutive UI where the user can easily navigate and easily find information (or recommendations in this case) within the app, without frustration.

<br>

### The plan
  
With just 48 hours, we spent quite a bit of time talking about ideas and how we can execute them. We took the time to do a bit of research and taking a step back to view the overall picture of a new gamer, which aided us greatly. We started doing wireframes to start the process and then refined it further as we had a good design in mind.

### The final product

Our solution was a simple and easy way of recommending a new player games based on their criteria. An onboarding process was made to ease in the user to the app and to tailor their preferences. The UI is centered around cards and minimalism, which results in a focus on the game and information shown.

The user can swipe left and right to show different recommendations, which makes it easy for the user to look for games and see the actual game. We selected cards as a form of UI because it was easy to show information and clean. We didn’t want to overload the user with multiple titles but rather one title at a time, until the user likes a recommended game.

We also added other elements like social media, sharing, wish lists, and favourites – Which enhances the experience further.

In the end, we wanted to reduce the frustration of finding games. Our secondary research showed that people often ask for recommendations online via social hubs like Reddit, Facebook, or Twitter. It shows that the abundance of games out there is quite large and is daunting to a new gamer today. We felt that we accomplished this by creating an app that is focused on doing one thing good, recommending quality games based on the user’s needs/preferences.

### The take aways

In this hackathon, the theme was challenging, and it was tough because we were competing against so many schools. We weren’t sure if our idea was going to work realistically but instead of worrying about that, we focused on what we believed, and I feel that we successfully did that. What I learned through this was: 

> Onboarding is key

I wanted to create a more unique interactive experience where the user can hover over an object and it will highlight it. Although, due to the nature of three.JS, I had to reduce my models to simple shapes - Which affected the overall design.
    
I had a dilemma where I wanted the functionality, but can I really sacrifice the visuals? Ultimately, I went with changing the pointer, rather than highlighting the object. As much as I was frustrated, I learned that sometimes you have provided a level of balance to aesthetics and functionality.

> Focus on one aspect

I learned to be resourceful and search online for things that I wanted to implement. For animating my fox model, I followed a tutorial. For understanding how three.js worked, I looked up the documentation. I understood that my Professor didn’t have all the answers (plus helping other students) but gave good advice in my direction and overall design.

> Working remotely with others kind of sucks

This was the first time I did a hackathon online and it was a bit challenging due to it being online. Although, one positive thing was that we could do it in our own home but I miss the interaction and working with others physically. Something about working in-person makes things feel more efficient and better.
