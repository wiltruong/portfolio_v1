### Delving into the world of futuristic UI and HUDs

After the Ubisoft NEXT competition in May, I wasn't satisified with my HUD mockups and I had larger ideas on the look and widgets. Although, I wasn't able to execute them due to the brief, I decided in July to work on this project as a personal portfolio piece and also learning futuristic UI plus (more) After Effects.

My vision for this HUD was to use futuristic UI in a game setting. From doing a bit of visual research, I noticed that most FUI is generally unusable from a UX standpoint and used often in movies as more of a visual piece as to something functional. This was my goal for this project, to create a HUD that is functional while retaining the futuristic UI look.

### Analyzing current battle royales and more

I started by looking into different battle royales such as Apex Legends, PUBG, Fortnite, Crucible, and CoD: Warzone. I noticed that most of the UI in the games are quite boxed in rather than floating (CoD was an exception). I was particularly interested in more digetic aspects of the UI, as I saw that most of the battle royales had UI that was very functional but wasn't really too aethestically pleasing. I feel that Apex Legends does this great with their UI, creating a unified look among different widgets of the HUD and making it functional.

As I started on the project, I kept in mind two things:

    <th align="center"></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th align="center"></th>
    <td align="center">Overall design</td>
    <td align="center"></td>
    <td align="center">Functionality</td>
    <td align="center"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<br>     

This resulted in me changing a few elements of a traditional UI, while retaining the FUI look. I had to think outside the box and think about how would a HUD would look plus how a player reads specific information in the heat of a battle.

<br>

### Expermenting with FUI

My first initial concepts were fairly odd, as I went towards a boxed look. This wasn't executed well as it was my first foray into FUI. I learned quite a bit doing this first version of the HUD, which prompted me to change directions and go towards more of a "helmet" HUD look - Which fit the theme of a sci-fi battle royale quite well. I used radials to show the health and ammo bar, as a visual aid plus using numbers instead of bars, so that the player can read the information quickly and accurately.

I was very inspired by Lone Echo, a VR game that I've played and loved. I really liked the overall aethestic and the small details in the UI around the ship plus how it looked. I experiemented with different ideas but this proved a little bit challenging. My iterations involved simulating a helmet HUD, where information is primarly on the sides and the bottom. I realized that this initial design a little big, as it look too much space, with a lot of information. I found out that it was crowded because of the widgets that I've included.

After a few more experimentations, I went in a different direction where I made it more simple by not overcomplicating the line art and molding the lines into the widgets so things were consistent and made it look it belonged in the UI.

### The final product

Overall, I'm very happy with the result. After getting feedback from a critique, I corrected some changes such as adjusting the colour opacity to make some widgets more consistent with the overall HUD. Plus, adding a few effects such as chromatic abbervation and an outer glow to soften things up.

### The take aways

In the end, I achieved what I wanted to do: which was creating a HUD that was functional and visually appealing. Deliving into FUI was really fun and I found that sometimes making it simple really helps as some FUI I've seen can be very complicated. A few things that I've learned through this was:

> Critiques can be scary sometimes

> Motion is (still) king

> Practice makes perfect!
