### Designing a game UI from scratch?!

One word that can describe this entire project/challenge is, passion. I love video games and pay a lot of attention to UI/UX, the aspiration of working on UI/UX at a top AAA studio like Ubisoft is a dream and a career goal. This challenge was centered around creating a UI style guide and also mock ups of a specific game from Ubisoft Toronto. Two were given, Splinter Cell: Blacklist and FarCry 4. I chose Splinter Cell as my strengths were in that area. Although, I thought it would be easy but I had to pay attention to a few things:

<br>

    <colgroup>
<col width="33.33%" />
<col width="33.33%" />
<col width="33.33%" />
</colgroup>
  <tr>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">Accessibility, making it legible for colour blindness and near-sightedness</td>
    <td align="center">Readability, easy to follow and navigate the menu</td>
    <td align="center">Design, ensuring that the typography, layout and visuals are in-line with branding</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<br>    

I had to balance this with my school and club work, so it was fun balancing all of that and taking the time to work on this. Needless to say, I was excited and raving to work on it during the weekends and whenever I had the time.

<br>

### The obstacles

I went with a simple idea of showing a life of an individual who has a low carbon footprint. The concept is to show the user on what he or she can do to make their lives eco-friendly. I wanted to bridge a connection between the user's interaction and the information that is being showed on the screen. 

<br>

<b>For example:</b> Instead of putting things like "buy an electric car to be environmentally friendly", the user can bike and save money plus lower their carbon footprint.

    <th align="center"></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th align="center"></th>
    <td align="center">Lower your carbon footprint by buying an electric car</td>
    <td align="center"></td>
    <td align="center">Save money and lower your carbon footprint by biking</td>
    <td align="center"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<br>     
    
For the overall design, I went with an isometric design with multiple levels in a house. The interactivity is for the user to navigate and learn about the specific things that a person can do to reduce their carbon footprint. I felt that an isometric 3D design would be appropriate due to the interactions and how I wanted the user to see an overview of the house and its areas.

### The iterations... So many of them



<br>

### The final product

My final design was quite a departure from what I initially planned. To create a more intimate relationship with the user, I created a character where the user can relate to. This allowed me to create a tour like experience where the character is leading the user to various places in the house. I was very inspired by visual novels with text boxes and characters.

With the addition of the character, I wanted it to animate so that was done through Adobe's Mixamo and a few pieces of code that I referenced via a <a href="https://tympanus.net/codrops/2019/10/14/how-to-create-an-interactive-3d-character-with-three-js/">tutorial by Kyle Wetton</a>. The idea was to let the character move its head accordingly to the user's mouse. This was a fun little quirk that I implemented since the character is cute and all, it provided a more fun and relaxing experience.

### The take aways

This project was the most challenging project I’ve ever done in a class setting. I set high ambitions to create a narrative that would easily flow with what I envisioned. I overcame a lot of challenges and became resourceful in figuring out what I needed to do to make my vision happen. There were a few things that I learned in this project:

> Functionality versus visuals

I wanted to create a more unique interactive experience where the user can hover over an object and it will highlight it. Although, due to the nature of three.JS, I had to reduce my models to simple shapes - Which affected the overall design.
    
I had a dilemma where I wanted the functionality, but can I really sacrifice the visuals? Ultimately, I went with changing the pointer, rather than highlighting the object. As much as I was frustrated, I learned that sometimes you have provided a level of balance to aesthetics and functionality.

> Being resourceful 

I learned to be resourceful and search online for things that I wanted to implement. For animating my fox model, I followed a tutorial. For understanding how three.js worked, I looked up the documentation. I understood that my Professor didn’t have all the answers (plus helping other students) but gave good advice in my direction and overall design.

> Being flexible

I realized throughout the project; things were constantly changing. From coding to the visual design. Being flexible was important as I was quite stubborn with sticking to what I wanted. As I moved forward in the project, somethings were just not possible (i.e. highlighting the object). There were things that I had to change based on feedback, but I learned that being a designer means having to adjust and adapt to things that don’t work too well with the plan.
