### Designing a game UI from scratch?!

One word that can describe this entire project/challenge is, passion. I love video games and pay a lot of attention to the UI/UX. The aspiration of working in UI/UX at a top AAA studio like Ubisoft is a dream and a career goal. This challenge was centered around creating a UI style guide and also mock ups of a specific game from Ubisoft Toronto. Two were given, Splinter Cell: Blacklist and FarCry 4. I chose Splinter Cell as my strengths were in that area of genre. At first, I thought it would be easy but I had to pay attention to a few things:

<br>

<table>
    <colgroup>
<col width="33.33%" />
<col width="33.33%" />
<col width="33.33%" />
</colgroup>
  <tr>
    <th align="center"><img src="https://wilsontruong.com/images/posts/aware.png"></th>
    <th align="center"><img src="https://wilsontruong.com/images/posts/person.png"></th>
    <th align="center"><img src="https://wilsontruong.com/images/posts/give.png"></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">Accessibility, making it legible for colour blindness and near-sightedness</td>
    <td align="center">Readability, easy to follow and navigate the menu</td>
    <td align="center">Design, ensuring that the typography, layout and visuals are in-line with branding</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<br>    

I had to balance this with my school and club work, so it was fun balancing all of that and taking the time to work on this. Needless to say, I was excited and raving to work on it during the weekends and whenever I had the time.

<br>

### The obstacles

This challenge was insanely tough but one thing that got me through the various challenges was iteration and taking that step back to think about the overall player UX and design. Without a doubt, I encountered two major challenging things:

<br>

<table>
  <colgroup>
<col width="15%" />
<col width="25%" />
<col width="20%" />
<col width="25%" />
<col width="15%" />
</colgroup>
  <tr>
    <th align="center"></th>
    <th align="center"><img src="https://wilsontruong.com/images/posts/car.png"></th>
     <th align="center"><b>Versus</b></th>
    <th align="center"><img src="https://wilsontruong.com/images/posts/bike.png"></th>
    <th align="center"></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th align="center"></th>
    <td align="center">Balancing accessibility with design</td>
    <td align="center"></td>
    <td align="center">UX and information hierarchy</td>
    <td align="center"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<br>     
    
Those challenges made me think how players can interact with a menu or HUD. I went with a typographic and simplistic look, to not overload the player's mind so that they can get into the menu and instantly know how to use the menu. Keeping it simple was the core concept and one of the major pillars for my design, as it is one of the trends for major AAA next gen game UI.

Accessibility was a critical thing for me to take in consideration (not only it was in the brief), as it was important for me to cater to that group and is emerging within the game development scene. To combat this, I implemented into my deisgns:

<br>

<table>
    <colgroup>
<col width="33.33%" />
<col width="33.33%" />
<col width="33.33%" />
</colgroup>
  <tr>
    <th align="center"><img src="https://wilsontruong.com/images/posts/aware.png"></th>
    <th align="center"><img src="https://wilsontruong.com/images/posts/person.png"></th>
    <th align="center"><img src="https://wilsontruong.com/images/posts/give.png"></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">typography with iconography, to enable those who are colour blinded to understand layers of information without colour</td>
    <td align="center">large text (more than 18px) such as headers to ensure that players can quickly read the menu from a distance</td>
    <td align="center">Using contrast to make text and icons be clear to those who are visually impared</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<br>

I constantly referred to the Association of Registered Graphic Designer's guide to 
<a href="https://www.rgd.ca/resources/accessibility/access">accessibility practices</a>, which was a great resource to refer to when designing my mocks.

<br>

### The iterations... So many of them

At first, my initial designs was to be a little bit bolder and use a grid system. I was heavily inspired by how The Division 2 layed out it's information and the overall design. As I thought more and more about the overall theme of Splinter Cell: Blacklist, I instantly knew that it will not work. It is not an looter-shooter, it is an stealth action-adventure game.

The constant going back and taking a step back to think about the player and the overall picture, really helped me to visualize how it would be used in an actual environment. I realized that as a gamer, complex menus are not fun, something that is intiuitive and easy to navigate is the key.

### The final product

The final design was a huge departure from what I initially sketched out on paper. As time went on and taking the feedback from the mid-point review, I instantly applied that feedback and changed directions. The result was something that I truly felt was my best work. An UI that is modern, fresh, and easily understood by anyone and everyone. An UI that can be taken for a remaster of a Splinter Cell game in 2020.

### The take aways

Balancing with my school and club work, I felt that this challenge was a test of my abilities and it really was. I enjoyed every second of idealizing and creating my mocks. The realization that working in UI/UX in games was beginning to come true. Throughout the process, I learned a lot from the industry, the judges, and also myself. From this challenge, my take aways were:

> Accessibility is important!


> Motion is king


> Believing in my strengths as a designer
